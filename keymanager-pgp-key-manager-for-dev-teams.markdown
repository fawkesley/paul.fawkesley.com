Keymanager ensures your dev team's PGP keys are correctly configured and up to date.

## Keep on top of team PGP keys

- Ensure your team's keys comply with your PGP policy
- Prevent PGP keys expiring with warning alerts
- Manage new team members with new key notifications for your domain
- Cross-check keys against Keybase, Github and public keyservers
- Discover malicious keys claiming to be @yourdomain.com

## Manage Github verified commits
