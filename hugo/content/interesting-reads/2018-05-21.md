*Interesting things I read on the Internet this week*

<!--more-->

- [Completely Silent Computer](https://tp69.wordpress.com/2018/04/17/completely-silent-computer/) — This gave me a pang of nostalgia, remembering my teen years building computers for friends and family. I'm seriously tempted to build a fully silent machine, the holy grail I never managed to achieve.

- [The sad state of sysadmin in the age of containers](https://www.vitavonni.de/blog/201503/2015031201-the-sad-state-of-sysadmin-in-the-age-of-containers.html) — Interesting from a security point of view — the fashion of installing software through "convenient" pre-built binary blobs. I wonder how many software images already contain backdoors?

- [Flopstarter](http://flopstarter.com/) — A platform for bad ideas. Amazing.

- ["... customers who are unable to arm/disarm or lock/unlock via the Nest app"](https://twitter.com/nestsupport/status/996955985343270913) — The real problem is centralisation — thermostats and doors locks should work even when Nest's infrastructure goes down, or the company goes bust or [abandons the product](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/05/revolv-devices-bricked-google-nest-smart-home). My own front door lock is [open source](https://www.github.com/paulfurley/doorbot) and runs on a tiny computer *in my home*. If I can do it, a megacorp like Nest can too.

- [EFAIL - vulnerability in email clients using PGP and S/MIME](https://efail.de/) — Researchers found a crypto-fail in the way some email clients handle encrypted HTML emails. They put out a [mysterious tweet](https://twitter.com/seecurity/status/995906576170053633) but bizarrely withheld the actual vulnerability, making it impossible to know what to advise. The [EFF jumped in with unhelpful advice](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/attention-pgp-users-new-vulnerabilities-require-you-take-action-now), and some sort of holy war broke out. It was a total mess.

- [LocationSmart API Vulnerability](https://www.robertxiao.ca/hacking/locationsmart/) — If you had real-time access to the location of every cellphone in the US, you'd protect that information really carefully, right?

- ['Huggybug Your Family Today': Don't play around with children's online safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_W-VkQ4oSk) — Brilliant spoof from Consumers International on the reality of internet-connected childrens' toys.
