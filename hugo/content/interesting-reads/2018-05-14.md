- [A Recycled IP Address Caused Me to Pirate 390,000 Books by Accident](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/a-recycled-ip-address-caused-me-to-pirate-390000-books-by-accident) — Don't leave old subdomain A records kicking around, lest your IP gets recycled.

- [Google just gave a stunning demo of Assistant making an actual phone call](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17332070/google-assistant-makes-phone-call-demo-duplex-io-2018) — Impressive tech, *awful* use case to choose for a demo. The fake "umm" and other human-like tricks just feel deceptive and dishonest to me.

- [Study: Seaweed in Cow Feed Reduces Methane Emissions Almost Entirely](https://foodtank.com/news/2017/06/seaweed-reduce-cow-methane-emission/) — Exciting, seaweed that inhibits cows from producing methane. Until such time that we stop eating such massive amounts of beef, perhaps this could limit the climate problem that is cow burps.

- [Alexa and Siri Can Hear This Hidden Command. You Can’t.](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/technology/alexa-siri-hidden-command-audio-attacks.html) — Now your TV, radio, and hi-fi can secretly control your home.

- [The Case for Electric Scooters](https://m.calcalistech.com/article.aspx?guid=3737880) — There are so many positives for electric scooters as urban transport, I'm really excited about these. Right now they're seen as childish but I suspect that won't last.

- [How a “location API” allows cops to figure out where we all are in real-time](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/senator-furious-at-polices-easy-ability-to-get-real-time-mobile-location-data/) — A loophole to avoid the inconvience of asking a judge for a warrant. Once again, if we collect intimadate date about people, it's only a matter of time before it gets misused.
