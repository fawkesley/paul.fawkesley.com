- [SpaceX can't broadcast Earth images because of a murky license](https://www.cnet.com/news/spacex-cant-broadcast-earth-images-because-of-a-murky-license/) — Apparently it requires a "commercial remote sensing licence" to transmit video from space back to Earth.

- [Mailinator launches disposable SMS](http://mailinator.blogspot.in/2018/04/mailinator-launches-disposable-sms.html?m=1) — Excellent development, especially as the number of things needlessly asking for my phone number seems to be increasing.

- [‘Big Brother’ in India Requires Fingerprint Scans for Food, Phones and Finances](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/technology/india-id-aadhaar.html) — I feel uncomfortable about the scale of this centralised database.

- [Department Of Homeland Security Compiling Database Of Journalists And 'Media Influencers'](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellefabio/2018/04/06/department-of-homeland-security-compiling-database-of-journalists-and-media-influencers/#77e18fc86121) — I don't know what to think about this, but it doesn't feel good.

- [The dots do matter: how to scam a Gmail user](https://jameshfisher.com/2018/04/07/the-dots-do-matter-how-to-scam-a-gmail-user) — Normalising Gmail addresses is a PITA.
