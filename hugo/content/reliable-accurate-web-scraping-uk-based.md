---
*For dirt-cheap web scraping, search [Elance][1] for "web scrapping" (!) Good luck!*

*For reliable and accurate web scraping, go to a professional web scraping company like [ScraperWiki][5] or an independent software engineer like me.*

*I offer pay-monthly managed web scraping starting at $50 per month, depending on size and complexity.*

## My Web Scraping Experience

I'm a [Software Engineer with a background in Electronic Engineering][2]. I write clean and supportable code - see some of my [work on GitHub][3].

I've written high-reliability web scrapers for many commercial clients at ScraperWiki as well as for my own projects.

Examples of my web scraping work:

  * web scraping company financial reports
  * pulling property price data from an API
  * web scraping director and shareholder information from eg. Companies House
  * web scraping news bulletins from stock exchanges
  * processing procurement data to power parts of [UK Government][4]
  * generating an events calendar from bookings on JustPark
  * reliable commodity price web scraping
  * accurate utility bill web scraping
  * scraping contact details from thousands of websites

## Web Scraping as a Service

First and foremost contact [ScraperWiki][5]. They have the capacity to take on large, complex projects and their Data Scientists can do additional data visualisation and analysis.

*Disclaimer: I worked for ScraperWiki in 2013/2014. They're great and we're still friends!*

If they're not suitable for you, [email me][6] with your specific requirements and we can arrange a call to discuss further.

I particularly enjoy working with charities, NGOs and Governments and I only do "ethical scraping" so no spammers please!

## Data Output

After web scraping I can provide a data feed in many different forms, for example:

  * Daily / weekly / monthly email attachment.
  * JSON API endpoint.
  * Regular SQL database dump.
  * SMS / Fax / Letter (!)
  * Most other ways you can think of!

## Ethical Web Scraping

I believe in "ethical scraping", operating within a set of principles:

  * A website that welcomes human visitors should welcome robots too.
  * A website should not discriminate against well-behaved robots; one that welcomes Google should welcome others too.
  * A scraper bot should try to identify itself as such, preferably with a contact URL and/or email address.
  * A scraper bot should not disrupt the service being scraped (it should use rate limiting and backoff).
  * A scraper should not be built to gain free access to an otherwise paid-for data product.
  * A scraper should not attempt to circumvent the security of a website.
  * A scraper should not facilitate plagiarism or copyright infringement.
  * A scraper should not help spammers or bad guys.
  * A scraper should not use anonymising proxies, Tor or dirty tricks to hide its origin.

**If that's all cool with you, then [get in touch][6].**
