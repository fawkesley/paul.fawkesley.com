        <h2>Why Globaleaks?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about human rights and internet freedom, and how we can use technology to organise and to hold power to account. I'm a volunteer at the Internet Freedom Festival and I've done some public speaking and technical writing in this area.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've stuck with free software and decentralised tools like GnuPG for almost two decades - despite their shortcomings - because it's essential that individuals have tools that aren't controlled by companies and governments.
        </p>

        <p>
          My voluntary work helping PGP users has connected me to lots of interesting journalists, lawyers and other activists and it's wonderful to support these people in their important work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working on the Globaleaks whistleblowing software would allow me to do what I do best, in the exact area that I want to do it.

      <h2>Relevant experience</h2>


      <h3>Expirybot (tools for PGP users), side project</h3>
      <p>2017 - present</p>

      <p>
      Expirybot is an open source service to makes life easier for PGP users. Currently it <a href="https://www.paulfurley.com/expirybot">reminds you when your key is about to expire,</a> and it <a href="https://www.expirybot.com/monitor-email-address/">monitors the keyservers</a> for potential impersonation.
      </p>

      <p>
      As I'm limited on time, I develop Expirybot by continually asking for feedback, listening, then building the next improvement. I love spending time really understanding problems and people's experience, then testing a minimal solution. If it works, I develop it further.
      </p>


      <h3>CTO - Projects By IF</h3>
      <p>2018 - present</p>

      <p>
      <a href="https://www.projectsbyif.com/">IF</a> is a specialist consultancy working in privacy, security and transparency. My (new) role is to lead on product development; helping the company begin to build sustainable products.

      <h3>Tech Lead, Digital Product Research, The Co-operative</h3>
      <p>2016 - 2017</p>

      <p>

      </p>

      <p>
      Highlights were Vault, an iOS application for scanning and securely storing documents, and <a href="https://github.com/coopdigital/atbash-chrome-extension">Atbash</a>, an Chrome extension which adds a 'send encrypted attachment' button to Gmail's web interface.
      </p>

      <h3>Developer, UK NHS</h3>
      <p>
        Developed user-centred prototypes of new services for type 2 diabetes patients. The multidisciplinary team worked in the open, carrying out cycles of formal user testing and iteration.
      </p>

      <h3>CTO / Tech Lead, Sea Level Research</h3>
      <p>2014 - 2015</p>

      <p>
        Built web app and backend API to provide improve tide predictions to the Liverpool Pilots who bring ships into the dock. I worked closely with the Pilots to understand their problems, then incrementally developed the application, getting their feedback at every stage.
      </p>

      <h3>Software Engineer, Government Digital Service</h3>
      <p>2013 - 2014</p>
      <p>

        <h2>Footnote: Engineer / Developer / Product Person</h2>
        <p>
          I'm an Engineer at heart - I'm happiest with my head in a terminal, creating code that's readable, tested and standards compliant. I'm happy with Linux, deployment, CI and running production services.
        </p>

        <p>
        I <i>also</i> love deeply understanding my users and using that to inform the product. I love testing things with people and seeing where my assumptions are wrong, then refining the assumptions.
        </p>

        <p>
        I find this combination of developer and product manager can be powerful, allowing me to build and iterate things that are genuinely useful to people.
