## Beneath the Surface: An Introduction to Information Hiding

It's been three months or so since I moved to Liverpool and I've had recently the pleasure of discovering [DoES][1], a coworking and maker community. It's been a treat to find similarly minded technologists, entrepreneurs and generally interesting people.
When the opportunity arose to bring together two of my hobbies, information security and public speaking, I jumped on it. On Tuesday 11th December I'll be doing a talk entitled *Beneath the Surface: An Introduction to Information Hiding*.Â  It sounds like an interesting night, more details over at [Matthew Hughes' blog][2].
