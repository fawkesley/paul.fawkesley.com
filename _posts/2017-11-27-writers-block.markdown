Today I'm experiencing something seriously strange for me - I can't face the idea of building!

<!--more-->

For the last 2 years or so I've been working full time and, sadly, there's been a shortage of building real stuff. I've learned tonnes about user research, hustling and testing product ideas, but have done very little significant building and almost no launching.

During that time, I was constantly thinking about building other things. At times I got hyper focused and used odd hours here and there to work on other projects. Some projects came to nothing, others launched and are going really well, but either way, I _loved_ those hours - they were pure creative bliss.

In short, I love building stuff. I love writing code and I love automating things - it's my favourite hobby and has been for as long as I can remember.


## Four products in four weeks?

Today is day one of a four week sabbatical I decided to take before jumping into a new, exciting gig which I'll write more about soon.

I had a very vague idea that I'd build and launch 4 things in 4 weeks. My backlog of ideas is more than long enough to choose from!

But over the weekend (when my girlfriend and I took a wonderful retreat at [Gladstone's Library][gladstones-library]) and today, I haven't been able to face the idea of choosing what to build, and the idea of starting is really daunting.

*Thinking deeply about anything but what to do in the next four weeks.*

Just a week ago I was bashing out code in the little spare time I had, but now, faced with a luxurious four weeks of freedom, I don't want to touch it...


## This will probably pass

Alright, panic over, this probably isn't going to last.

Reflecting on why I'm feeling like this, a couple of things come to mind.



* I'm **knackered** from a boozy final week and an intense and stressful project I was trying to keep alive in Ian's absence during November.
* I've done a [**lot** of one or two week product sprints][dpr-website] in the last year, and most of them were canned. That cycle of all-in-then-throw-away is exhausting and frustrating, and doing 4 products in 4 weeks feels like just more of the same.
* Launching a product is maybe 20% building and 80% hustling, listening, sketching, debating, testing and iterating. Butâ€¦ it's **making** that I've desperately missed. Fuck all the other stuff, I just want to make some frivolous stuff!


## Plan B: celebrate being frivolous, with lots of writing

The last 2 years I've learned a tonne of product stuff that's not making. That stuff will be super useful in the future.

But right now I think my medicine is making.

I think what I'd like to do is a mix of frivolous making and other local things I can't do while I'm working. Like meditating at [Sefton Park Palm House][palm-house] on a Wednesday morning. And going to [Transition Liverpool's][transition-liverpool] afternoon meeting. And doing phone calls with friends and future friends from the [Internet Freedom Festival][iff]

I'd like to look back on this time and feel it was worthwhile. I don't want the time to slip away. I'd also love to better at writing regularly. I think documenting my days could be good for both. At the very least, it should be a lovely record to look back at.

Thanks for reading, and until next time.
