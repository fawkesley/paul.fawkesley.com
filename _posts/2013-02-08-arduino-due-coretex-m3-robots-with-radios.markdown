I recently learned that the new <a title="Arduino Due" href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDue" target="_blank">Arduino Due</a> shares a processor architecture with the board I used for my Masters robotics project back in 2009. The <a title="ARM Coretex-M3" href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m3.php" target="_blank">ARM Coretex-M3</a> was a powerful beast - running it at a mere 8MHz was easily sufficient for my needs!

It was a great project in which I got to design and build some robots, design a PCB and write a tonne of embedded C to get the things talking to each other. It seemed wrong to let it languish unopened on my machine, so I thought I'd put it out there.

I've uploaded the whole project write-up along with a summary and visual highlights, all of which [can be found here](/cooperative-mobile-robots-meng-project/)

The PCB on top is a Luminary Micro evaluation board with an ARM Coretex-M3 processor. I designed the PCB below that board and the sensors housings mounted on the front and back of the chassis.
