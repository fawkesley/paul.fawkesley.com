*Interesting things I read on the Internet this week*

<!--more-->

- [Signal >> Blog >> Amazon threatens to suspend Signal's AWS account over censorship circumvention](https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/) — Two weeks ago [I wrote about](https://www.paulfurley.com/interesting-reads-2018-04-23/) Google blocking domain fronting, a censorship circumvention technique. Now Amazon has done the same. This is big news in the internet freedom community who relied on this to operate in oppressive countries.

- [On the Shortness of Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97412.On_the_Shortness_of_Life?from_search=true) — I've found a lot of wisdom recently from Seneca, a Roman stoic. Among many other things he talks about materialism, greed, inequality and the fallacy of seeking happiness through possessions. It's astonishing reading a 2000 year old text and thinking it could have been written yesterday.

- [‘I had to guard an empty room’: the rise of the pointless job](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/04/i-had-to-guard-an-empty-room-the-rise-of-the-pointless-job) — David Graeber elaborates on categories of 'bullshit job', those which the people doing them think might as well not exist. There's a hypocrisy in this — our society is so rich it can pay people to waste time, but it can't (yet) accept the idea of a basic income, and people working fewer hours.

- [UK regulator orders Cambridge Analytica to release data on US voter](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/05/cambridge-analytica-uk-regulator-release-data-us-voter-david-carroll) — Quite a big deal — the UK ICO is forcing Cambridge Analytica to uphold a US citizen's request for data held about him.

- [Chinese debtors shamed with broadcast of names and faces on giant screens on May 1 holiday](http://m.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2144690/chinese-debtors-shamed-broadcast-names-and-faces-giant-screens) — Embracing capitalism.

- [Unroll.me to close to EU users saying it can’t comply with GDPR](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/05/unroll-me-to-close-to-eu-users-saying-it-cant-comply-with-gdpr/) — Good riddance, I hope GDPR kills off more deceptive businesses. For background, unroll.me accesses your whole email inbox to help you mass unsubscribe from newsletters. [Last year](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/technology/personal-data-firm-slice-unroll-me-backlash-uber.html) it came out that they were selling people's Lyft receipts to Uber, causing outrage as people hadn't realised that's what they'd "agreed" to.
