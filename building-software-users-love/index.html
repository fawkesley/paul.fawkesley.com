<h1 itemprop="headline">Building Software Users Love</h1>

<p><em>This was originally posted on the <a href="http://transformation.blog.nhs.uk/building-software-users-love">NHS.UK Alpha project</a> blog.</em></p>

<p>I’m Paul, and I’m a developer on the NHS.UK Alpha project. I wanted to share some thoughts about different ways of delivering software, and why we’re working in the way we are.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="its-hard-building-for-users-you-dont-understand">It’s Hard Building for Users You Don’t Understand</h2>

<p>I have some experience working in organisations where software was written to a specification – a large document which supposedly captured everything there was to know about a problem.</p>

<p>A hypothetical project would go something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business analyst works with the users’ manager to understand the users’ problems</li>
  <li>Business analyst writes lots of requirements documents detailing <em>exactly</em> what the software should do and how</li>
  <li>Development team receive requirements and make lots of interpretations where things aren’t clear (they never are)</li>
  <li>Project is delivered, client’s users see the system for the first time, start giving feedback about what’s wrong</li>
  <li>Any changes must go through “change request” process – it’s like a new piece of work.</li>
  <li>The interesting thing for me was the observation that <strong>it’s hard building software for users you don’t understand.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I think one of the problems with this type of delivery is that there’s a bit of a Chinese whisper situation going on, where every re-telling of the user need distorts the truth:</p>

<ol>
  <li>users tell their boss about their problems, not mentioning the hacks and workarounds they currently do</li>
  <li>their boss tells the business analyst, forgetting some of the detail</li>
  <li>the business analyst writes it down, losing some nuance</li>
  <li>the developers read the document and make their own interpretations.</li>
</ol>

<p>To compound the problem, when software is delivered in one great lump – at the end of the project – it’s too late for feedback from the real users.</p>

<h2 id="build-test-iterate">Build, Test, Iterate</h2>

<p>I’ll come right out and say it: <strong>I don’t think users ever like version 1!</strong></p>

<p>However good we are at capturing user’s needs, I just think that users have to get their hands on the software before we <em>really</em> know what they need.</p>

<p>So an alternative approach, and the one we’re practising at NHS.UK Alpha, is <strong>Build, Test, Iterate</strong>.</p>

<p>The principle is simple enough – you build something small, you try it out on your users, you see what they love and hate, and you do it again, quickly.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-simple">Keep it Simple</h2>

<p>With everything we build, we try to start simple. It’s always tempting to throw in the kitchen sink, or think up every situation where a solution <em>wouldn’t</em> work. The danger with that is that it’s easy to end up never building anything.</p>

<p>If we have a very broad user base (which in health, we do), it’s helpful to create “personas” – made up people who are based on user interviews, but are specific rather than general. Then we create a solution which works for one of them first, then expand the solution to other personas, if possible.</p>

<p>Personas help to eliminate disagreement about how people on the team think a solution should be. They allow the team to put aside our own opinions and build for the needs of the persona, which reduces our own bias.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-cheap-fake-it">Keep it Cheap (Fake it)</h2>

<p>Iterating fast is essential, because each round of testing produces a lot of feedback. At each stage, it’s useful to ask the question, <em>“How could we fake a solution well enough to test it?”</em></p>

<p>Using paper and pens is a very fast way of getting ideas out of our heads and in front of users. Although it has limitations – for example it’s hard to show user-interface interactions on paper – it’s much faster than writing code, and users are often perfectly able to pretend they are tapping on an tablet.</p>

<p>We’re also faking it with our prototyping kit. We’ve built <em>just enough</em> backend so that it feels to a user like they’re really booking an appointment, or searching for a GP. We’ve spent exactly no time making it “production ready” – because this is a prototype. We tested it early, so if they’d absolutely hated it, or had no need for it, we would have found out quickly so the cost of throwing it away is low.</p>

<h2 id="developers-get-involved">Developers: Get Involved</h2>

<p>Being a developer isn’t just about writing code.</p>

<p>Writing code is important, but writing the <em>right</em> code is better.</p>

<p>We don’t like waste, and I think we can reduce it by being involved at all stages – from participating in user lab days, to scribbling with sharpies on paper, to implementing production systems.</p>

<p>Ultimately, when we understand the user, it’s easier to build things they love. And that means happy faces all round :)</p>
