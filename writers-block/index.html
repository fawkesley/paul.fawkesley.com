<p>Today I’m experiencing something seriously strange for me - I can’t face the idea of building!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>For the last 2 years or so I’ve been working full time and, sadly, there’s been a shortage of building real stuff. I’ve learned tonnes about user research, hustling and testing product ideas, but have done very little significant building and almost no launching.</p>

<p>During that time, I was constantly thinking about building other things. At times I got hyper focused and used odd hours here and there to work on other projects. Some projects came to nothing, others launched and are going really well, but either way, I <em>loved</em> those hours - they were pure creative bliss.</p>

<p>In short, I love building stuff. I love writing code and I love automating things - it’s my favourite hobby and has been for as long as I can remember.</p>

<h2 id="four-products-in-four-weeks">Four products in four weeks?</h2>

<p>Today is day one of a four week sabbatical I decided to take before jumping into a new, exciting gig which I’ll write more about soon.</p>

<p>I had a very vague idea that I’d build and launch 4 things in 4 weeks. My backlog of ideas is more than long enough to choose from!</p>

<p>But over the weekend (when my girlfriend and I took a wonderful retreat at <a href="https://www.gladstoneslibrary.org/">Gladstone’s Library</a>) and today, I haven’t been able to face the idea of choosing what to build, and the idea of starting is really daunting.</p>

<p><img src="/img/paul-in-gladstones-library.jpg" alt="Paul looking thoughtful in Gladstone's library" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p><em>Thinking deeply about anything but what to do in the next four weeks.</em></p>

<p>Just a week ago I was bashing out code in the little spare time I had, but now, faced with a luxurious four weeks of freedom, I don’t want to touch it…</p>

<h2 id="this-will-probably-pass">This will probably pass</h2>

<p>Alright, panic over, this probably isn’t going to last.</p>

<p>Reflecting on why I’m feeling like this, a couple of things come to mind.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m <strong>knackered</strong> from a boozy final week and an intense and stressful project I was trying to keep alive in Ian’s absence during November.</li>
  <li>I’ve done a <a href="https://dpr.coop.co.uk"><strong>lot</strong> of one or two week product sprints</a> in the last year, and most of them were canned. That cycle of all-in-then-throw-away is exhausting and frustrating, and doing 4 products in 4 weeks feels like just more of the same.</li>
  <li>Launching a product is maybe 20% building and 80% hustling, listening, sketching, debating, testing and iterating. But… it’s <strong>making</strong> that I’ve desperately missed. Fuck all the other stuff, I just want to make some frivolous stuff!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="plan-b-celebrate-being-frivolous-with-lots-of-writing">Plan B: celebrate being frivolous, with lots of writing</h2>

<p>The last 2 years I’ve learned a tonne of product stuff that’s not making. That stuff will be super useful in the future.</p>

<p>But right now I think my medicine is making.</p>

<p>I think what I’d like to do is a mix of frivolous making and other local things I can’t do while I’m working. Like meditating at <a href="http://palmhouse.org.uk/">Sefton Park Palm House</a> on a Wednesday morning. And going to <a href="http://www.transitionliverpool.org/">Transition Liverpool’s</a> afternoon meeting. And doing phone calls with friends and future friends from the <a href="https://internetfreedomfestival.org/">Internet Freedom Festival</a></p>

<p>I’d like to look back on this time and feel it was worthwhile. I don’t want the time to slip away. I’d also love to better at writing regularly. I think documenting my days could be good for both. At the very least, it should be a lovely record to look back at.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and until next time.</p>
