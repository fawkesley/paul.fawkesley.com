## Help support Expirybot's future

[Expirybot][expirybot] takes time and money to run and develop.

Happily, I love spending time building useful things.

If you'd like to support my wallet and boost my motivation, here are some ideas that would be super helpful:

- Offer free VPS hosting or bulk email sending
- [Buy me a beer][buy-me-a-beer] (Paypal & Bitcoin gratefully accepted)
- Write a short testimonial I can put on a website
- Give me feedback on [Expirybot for Teams][expirybot-for-teams]
- [Do a 2-minute survey][user-research] to help me understand how you use PGP
- [Say hello by email][email] - I'd love to hear from you!

You rock.

Paul
