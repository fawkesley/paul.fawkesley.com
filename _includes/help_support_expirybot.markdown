## Support Expirybot and other PGP projects

[Expirybot][expirybot] takes time and money to run and develop.

Happily, I love spending time building useful things.

If you'd like to support my wallet and boost my motivation, here are some ideas that would be super helpful:

- Take a look at [Fluidkeys, software to automate your team's PGP keys][fluidkeys]
- [Buy me a beer][buy-me-a-beer] (Paypal & Bitcoin gratefully accepted)
- [Do a 2-minute survey][user-research] to help me understand how you use PGP
- [Say hello by email][email] - I'd love to hear from you!

You rock.

Paul
